# Pricing Panel Project
A quick and easy code project from Colt Steele's udemy course. 

Attempted to first use the visual provided to attain the same aesthetic without the videos first, but did need to reference the videos to check work and implement desired hover functions. 

Overall helped to solidify simple flexbox principles and mobile-first.
